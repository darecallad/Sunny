            We were looking for a new daycare after a horrible small in home
            daycare experience. Our child would scream without stopping at the
            home daycare. after putting our kid in this daycare for three days.
            It was the most stressful situation I have ever dealt with. Needless
            to say I will never do another home daycare again. I found Building
            Kidz and took a tour. I was a little hesitant due to covid but after
            hearing about their protocols I honestly feel it’s safer than a home
            daycare. The facility is new and they do deep cleanings every night
            as well as regular testing of teachers for covid. This is much more
            stringent than a lot of daycare protocols I’ve seen. I was also
            afraid because my son was 11 months he might have issues adjusting
            especially because of what happened at the home daycare. Both
            stefanie and elissa were AMAZING in helping my kid adjust. It took
            my son Ten minutes the first day and after a week he doesn’t even
            cry at drop off! Which is saying a lot considering he wouldn’t stop
            crying with his previous daycare. They take tons of pictures and
            videos of my kid so I don’t feel like I’m missing out and he ALWAYS
            looks super happy. They’ll notice small things like a small rash or
            if his temperament has changed due or getting shots and keep me
            informed. If anyone is looking for a good daycare I highly recommend
            this one.
